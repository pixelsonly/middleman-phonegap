# middleman-phonegap

**middleman-phonegap** is a [Middleman 3.x](http://middlemanapp.com) project
template for [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) with [Haml](http://haml.info),
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org).

Using [Bundler](http://gembundler.com) and [RVM](https://rvm.io) or
[rbenv](http://rbenv.org) is **highly** recommended.

**Only supports iOS (for now).**

### Includes
* [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org) (v2.9.0)
* [FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) (v0.6.7)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) (v2.0.2)

### Requires
* [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com)
* [ios-sim](https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim)

  If you're on OS X, [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is the simples way to install
  [ios-sim](https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim):
  ```bash
  $ brew install ios-sim
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone **middleman-phonegap** into `~/.middleman`. You will need to create
   this directory if it doesn't exist.
   ```bash
   $ git clone git://github.com/pixelsonly/middleman-phonegap.git ~/.middleman/middleman-phonegap
   ```

2. Download and install [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/download/) if you haven't
   already.

3. Create a PhoneGap project by running the *create* command,
   [see docs for help](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.9.0/guide_command-line_index.md.html#Command-Line%20Usage_ios):
   ```bash
   $ ./path/to/cordova-ios/bin/create /path/to/new_phonegap_project com.example.cordova_project_name PhonegapProjectName
   ```

4. Initialize Middleman with the template on the PhoneGap project you just
   created:
   ```bash
   $ middleman init existing_phonegap_project --template=middleman-phonegap
   ```

## Usage

**middleman-phonegap** hooks into the Middleman build process, merges the
compiled assets with the PhoneGap structure, compiles the iOS application and
launches the iOS Simulator with a single command.

Run
```bash
$ middleman build
```
from project root.
